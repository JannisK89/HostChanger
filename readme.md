# Host Changer

Simple CLI tool written for switching between hostfiles for different environments.
This was written to automate a common hostfile switch I was doing a couple of times a day. 
You propably have no need for this tool, it's way too specific for my environment/setup.

## Installation
1. Install Go - https://go.dev/dl/
2. Clone git repo
3. Run ```go build``` 
4. Execute binary and follow instructions
